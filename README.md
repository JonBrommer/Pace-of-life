# Pace-of-life

Code related to workshop "Towards a general theory of the Pace of Life Syndrome"
This is ideas I and others who are part of this workshop ae trying to develop


At present, simply includes some numerical examples of the concept we are developing
The main thought is to apply the concept of generation time (as a measure of POL) to all levels (individual, population, species), as well as to link the "slow-fast" to the allocation-acquisition framework
